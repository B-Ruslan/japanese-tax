          Japanese Tax Calculator for Newcomers and Expats
        </h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Tax Calculator for people moving to Japan! We know how hard it could be to estimate whether it is a good idea to make this move.
            So, this simple tool allows you to calculate how much taxes you would pay after landing a nice gig in the country. However, this website is created for reference only.
            Please do not get mad if the real bill will be a little different. Good luck and have fun!
